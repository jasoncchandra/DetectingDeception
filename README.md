# Detecting Deception
A Machine Learning Quest Against Fake News.

Growing up, I was always the family's go-to tech-savvy person, helping them navigate the digital world. However, one incident hit close to home and drove me to tackle the issue of fake news. My family's grandma and grandpa fell victim to a fake news that they encountered online. This misinformation led to unnecessary stress and confusion for them. This personal experience sparked me to develop a solution that could help people like my grandparents distinguish fact from fiction. Through this project, I'm on a mission to use machine learning to empower individuals to make informed decisions, safeguarding them from the pitfalls of misinformation in the digital age.


**Problem Definition**:

The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fake news articles from a dataset of news articles. Fake news has become a prevalent issue in today's digital age, with potentially severe consequences for individuals and society. Detecting fake news is a challenging task that requires natural language processing and classification techniques.

**Project Summary**:

**Background**:
The proliferation of digital news and social media platforms has made it easier for fake news to spread rapidly. Misleading or fabricated news articles can have far-reaching impacts on public opinion, politics, and even public health. This project addresses the critical need to develop an automated system that can identify and flag potentially fake news articles.

**Objective**:
The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles. To achieve this, the project follows a multi-step process:

**1. Data Acquisition**:
   - The project begins with the acquisition of a labeled dataset containing news articles. The dataset is typically divided into two classes: "real" and "fake" news.

**2. Data Preprocessing**:
   - The raw text data undergoes preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming (or lemmatization). Special characters, numbers, and stopwords are removed to prepare the text for analysis.

**3. Feature Engineering**:
   - Feature engineering involves converting the text data into numerical form. In this project, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is used to represent the text data as numerical features.

**4. Model Selection and Training**:
   - Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored for classification, including Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and SVM. 

**5. Model Evaluation**:
   - The models are evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The goal is to assess each model's ability to correctly classify real and fake news. If time permits, I will also look into k-cross-validation.

**6. Interpretability and Error Analysis**:
   - Efforts are made to interpret model decisions and conduct error analysis to understand why certain predictions are incorrect. This step can provide insights for model improvement.

**Conclusion**:
The project's ultimate goal is to contribute to the fight against fake news by providing a tool that assists users in making informed decisions about the credibility of news articles. The project's success is measured by the model's ability to accurately distinguish between real and fake news while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

By addressing this critical issue, the project aims to promote media literacy and responsible information consumption, ultimately benefiting individuals and society as a whole.
